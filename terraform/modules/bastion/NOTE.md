# NOTE

## Why This Setup? (Resource-by-Resource)

This module provisions a secure, minimal bastion host for controlled access to your cloud resources. Here's the reasoning for every variable, resource, and output, with analogies:

- **Variables**

  - **name**: Name of the bastion VM. Analogy: Like naming your guardhouse at the city gate.
  - **machine_type**: VM size. Analogy: Choosing the size of your guardhouse—enough for the guards, but not a palace.
  - **zone**: GCP zone for the VM. Analogy: Picking which city district your guardhouse is in.
  - **image**: Boot disk image. Analogy: The blueprint for building the guardhouse—what tools and furniture are inside.
  - **disk_size_gb**: Boot disk size. Analogy: How much storage space the guards have for their gear.
  - **network**: VPC network. Analogy: Which city walls the guardhouse is built into.
  - **subnetwork**: Subnet for the VM. Analogy: The specific street or block for the guardhouse.
  - **metadata**: Extra metadata for the VM. Analogy: Special instructions or notes for the guards.

- **Resource: google_compute_instance.bastion**

  - Provisions the bastion VM with a public IP, minimal tags, and a startup script. Analogy: Building a secure guardhouse with a phone line (public IP) and a checklist for the guards (startup script).
  - **boot_disk**: Uses the specified image and size. Analogy: Stocking the guardhouse with the right supplies.
  - **network_interface**: Connects to the right network/subnet and enables external access. Analogy: Placing the guardhouse at the city wall with a door to the outside.
  - **tags**: Used for firewall rules. Analogy: Marking the guardhouse for special security rules.
  - **metadata**: Enables OS Login and runs the startup script. Analogy: Giving guards a secure login system and a morning routine.

- **Startup Script (bastion_startup.sh)**

  - Installs essential tools (gcloud, kubectl, git, htop, etc.). Analogy: Equipping the guards with radios, keys, and maps so they can do their job securely and efficiently.

- **Outputs**
  - **name, machine_type, zone, image, disk_size_gb, network, subnetwork, metadata**: Expose all key VM details for automation and auditing. Analogy: Like keeping a record of the guardhouse's specs for city planners.
  - **internal_ip**: Internal IP for private access. Analogy: The guardhouse's address inside the city walls.
  - **external_ip**: Public IP for secure remote access. Analogy: The guardhouse's phone number for trusted visitors.

## Analogy

This setup is like building a secure, well-equipped guardhouse at the edge of your city: only trusted guards (users) can enter, they have all the tools they need, and you control exactly where it's built and how it's accessed. Every field, variable, and output is about making access clear, auditable, and safe—without giving away the keys to the whole city.
